Small project for rainmeter made with a friend

Very personalized, users should edit the code if they want to change to another character/sprite/image

Instructions:
Go to your skins folder and create a new folder skin name (lets call it test)

Make a subfolder called @resources

Save the image files in @resources

Go back to test

Make a new text file (end it with the extension .ini)

Copy and paste the code for momo.ini into the text file

Lastly, go to Manage Rainmeter and run the .ini file.

End Result for rikka.ini:

End Result for momo.ini:

Also, if you're into making a sprite for your desktop manager, I suggest using
